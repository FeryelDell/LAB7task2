# Lab 7 - Java Inheritance

This program demonstrates multi-level inheritance in Java using an abstract `Animal` class. Subclasses include `Mammal` > `Dog`, `Bird` > `Pigeon`, and `Fish` > `Blowfish`, each with specific fields and behaviors. 
The program shows method overriding and polymorphism by storing all animals in an array and calling their methods in the `Main` class.
